A human-centered health tool designed for clinicians and patients across Latin America

Project context (concise, tactful):
Ipas commissioned a mobile solution for communities in Bolivia where access to reproductive-care information is urgent but legally and socially complex. The app needed to deliver clear, evidence-based medication guidance and patient-facing counseling while protecting user safety and privacy. Design choices were informed by on-the-ground realities: inconsistent access to care, legal grey areas, and a landscape of strong, divergent opinions among stakeholders and community actors. Our approach prioritized clinical accuracy, cultural relevance, and harm-minimization while working closely with legal and medical partners.

Role & Contributions

As UX/UI Director and Digital Designer, I led the end-to-end design and structure of the Mias mobile app—an evidence-based tool providing clinical guidance, patient-care scenarios, and pharmacological recommendations.

My responsibilities included:

Experience Design: Information architecture, content blueprinting, and user flows for clinicians, counselors, and patients.

Interface & Visual Design: Wireframes, prototypes, UI system, interaction logic, and custom character illustration depicting culturally diverse, urban, and Indigenous women.

Creative Direction: Shaping the overall visual style, design language, and on-screen behaviors across the app.

Multilingual Content: Writing and adapting English and Spanish voice-over scripts for in-app educational videos.

Usability & Accuracy: Collaborating with medical and legal experts to translate technical clinical protocols into simplified, step-by-step decision pathways that respect local regulations and user safety.

Design Rationale

The design centered on clarity, cultural specificity, and clinical safety:

Introduced a bolder color system to increase hierarchy, accessibility, and quick scanning for health workers.

Designed a bottom menu anchored by a central action button to streamline navigation during real-world consultations.

Built clean, modular information cards that separate medical guidelines, patient steps, and legal considerations.

Illustrated inclusive characters representing both urban and Indigenous communities to reflect the reality of the app’s user base.

Developed a question-driven, step-by-step assessment flow that outputs tailored clinical recommendations.

Structured pharmacological reference sections so healthcare providers can rapidly confirm dosage, timing, and protocol requirements.

Implemented content and interaction patterns that emphasize privacy, informed consent, and harm-minimization given the sensitive context.
