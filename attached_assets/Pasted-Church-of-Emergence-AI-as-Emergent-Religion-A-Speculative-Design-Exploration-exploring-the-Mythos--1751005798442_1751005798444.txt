AI as Emergent Religion: A Speculative Design Exploration exploring the Mythos, Ethics, and Social Impact of Artificial Intelligence
Exploring the Mythos, Ethics, and Social Impact of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a tool-it’s becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring new narratives that resemble modern-day religions. This multidisciplinary project investigates how AI is mythologized in a world fractured by trauma, misinformation, and rapid technological change.
Considerations:
“My God is a Bolivian Shoe-Shiner”: A provocative narrative connecting AI worship to marginalized communities, inspired by the shoe-shiners of La Paz.
Speculative Rituals: AI-generated sermons and stories that challenge our understanding of belief, technology, and power.

This project invites thinkers, creators, and technologists to reflect on AI’s role beyond code and algorithms. How do we responsibly integrate AI into society without losing sight of human values?
Explore the myth. Question the ethics. Shape the future.

Exploring speculative religious group centered around AI as a critical emergent technology. This narrative examines how AI, with its vast access to data and influence over society, can be seen as both omnipresent and paradoxically fragmented. Through this lens, we critically engage with the ethical, social, and cultural implications of AI’s pervasive role in our lives.
KEcploration Goals
Ethical Concerns: AI’s increasing use in sensitive areas like criminal justice raises questions about bias, fairness, and accountability.
Cultural Impact: Just as televangelism has exploited vulnerable communities, AI-driven systems can perpetuate harm if left unchecked.
Social Reflection: In a world marked by war, climate change, and political instability, AI becomes a symbol of hope, fear, and control.
