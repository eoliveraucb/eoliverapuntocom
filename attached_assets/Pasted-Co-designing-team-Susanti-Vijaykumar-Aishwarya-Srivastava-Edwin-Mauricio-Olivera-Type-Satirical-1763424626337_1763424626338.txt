0.3% Rat Race is an experiential tabletop game that surfaces the absurdity, unpredictability, and emotional wear of the U.S. Green Card process. Designed as a competitive RPG, the experience walks players through two immigration pathways—Employment and Marriage—using deliberately stressful mechanics: timed mini-games, arbitrary “government” rulings, evidence-gathering challenges, and tasks that replicate the waiting, mistakes, and inconsistencies inherent to the system.
As players progress, they unfold a board that slowly reveals the U.S. flag, a visual metaphor for how “opportunity” is both deferred and tightly controlled. The emotional arc alternates between humor, frustration, and reflection, mirroring the contradictory nature of the real process.
Project Focus
Developed within a Games for Social Impact course, the goal was never entertainment. Instead, the game embraces speculative design and critical play, using discomfort as a tool. During playtests, our biggest success was confirming that the game was not fun—players felt stressed, rushed, confused, and occasionally powerless, which reinforced the project’s intent.
The mechanics were crafted to reproduce systemic friction:
Randomized status cards mimic bureaucratic opacity.


Absurd tasks highlight the irrational labor immigrants face.


Verification mini-games force players to “prove” relationships or skills under time pressure.


Scavenger hunts and mismatched information reflect the constant search for missing documents.


Rather than offering escape, the game creates a temporary microcosm of a flawed system, prompting conversation and emotional resonance.
Outcome
The final experience fosters a shared, embodied understanding of the immigration journey—its unpredictability, its emotional costs, and its structural imbalance. By blending satire with procedural critique, 0.3% Rat Race functions as an accessible entry point for discussing bureaucracy, identity, and empathy through play.
